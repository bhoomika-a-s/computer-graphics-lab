### this repository will help you to learn computer graphics using opengl in python.
### OpenGL is a graphics library which is supported by multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and is available for use in multiple other languages as well; however, the scope of this post will be limited to its usage in the Python programming language.
### The first thing we need to do to use OpenGL in our code is to import it. To do that, run the following command:
```
import OpenGL
```
### Before we proceed, there are a few other libraries that you need to import whenever you intend to use this library in your program. Below is the code for those imports:
```
import OpenGL.GL
import OpenGL.GLUT
import OpenGL.GLU
```
